# clockwork
A small CLI for timing conversion from osu! to Soundodger 2. I originally made this with only my own use in mind; thus, this tool only covers osu! to Soundodger 2 conversion, but I am planning to cover more music games in the future.

## Requirements
Clockwork requires a few things to run:
- [python v3.11 or higher](https://www.python.org/)
- [click v8.1 or higher](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/)
- [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/)

[zenlog](https://github.com/ManufacturaInd/python-zenlog) is recommended but not required; if not installed, the log messages will just be uglier.
All of the packages aformentionned can easily be installed with pip.
